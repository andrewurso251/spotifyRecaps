# spotifyRecaps
To initialize the project open the directory of the project in your terminal and run "npm start" 
In the expo initialization select "a" to open up an android emulator on your computer (Android Studio with the $PATH variables properly set up is required
it is easiest to do this when running the code in Android Studio)

This app will generate "random" facts from  user data pulled from the Spotify Web API. If you would like to get the most recent data from your account, 
just restart the app, otherwise the facts will be generated from the data on login.
